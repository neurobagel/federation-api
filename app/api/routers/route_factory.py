# TODO: if our response model for fully successful vs. not fully successful responses grows more complex in the future,
# consider additionally using https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/additional-responses/#additional-response-with-model
# when defining API routes to document example responses for different status codes in the OpenAPI docs
# (less relevant for now since there is only one response model).
